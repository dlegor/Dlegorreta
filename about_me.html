					<h2 style="font-weight: bold;padding-left:30px;">About me</h2>
				</header>
				<p style="padding-left:20px;">My name is <b>Daniel Legorreta</b>, my major is physics and mathematics 
					and my specialization is in pure mathematics, but for more than 
					8 years I have worked as an analytical consultant creating 
					statistical models, machine learning and deep learning models and 
					developing Big Data technologies. I am a dedicated professional, 
					enthusiastic and passionate about my work. <br/></p>

					<p style="padding-left:20px;">I have often worked as an independent or independent consultant 
						on some projects, but also for a long time I have worked in 
						international financial institutions and international consulting 
						in different projects.<br/></p>
						
						<p style="padding-left:20px;">I usually work on topics such as: </p>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Implementation of supervised and unsupervised models.</li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Creation of models and components for anomaly detection.</li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Development of code for processing in distribution systems.</li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Application of NLP techniques (chatbots, semantic search, classification of texts, etc.).</li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Creation of dashboard or visualizations.</li><br/>
						
						<p style="padding-left:20px;">I have always loved learning and researching new techniques or algorithms and testing them in a personal project. 
						I always try to update myself about the technologies.
						I love math, so I'm always reading, reviewing or learning something new about them. 
						Especially in algebraic topology, geometry, probability and large graphics. Today, 
						those subfields in mathematics are related to many topics in Machine Learning, 
						Deep Learning and Computer Science in general.</p>
						<p style="padding-left:20px;">Below you can find some research links on the relationship between mathematics 
							and computer science.</p>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">Algebraic Topology and Data.</a></li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;"><a href="http://geometricdeeplearning.com">Geometry and Deep Learning.</a></li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;">Everything in Machine Learning is Probability, 
							so I always recommend reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1">Kevin Murphy's book.</a></li>
						<li style="padding-left:20px;"><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/graphrepresentation-ieee17.pdf">The graphics and the large graphics is a huge topic, 
							so it is impossible to give just one reference.</a></li>

							<h2 style="font-weight: bold;padding-left:30px;">Background and Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="padding-left:20px;">My major was in pure mathematics, I graduated from <a href="https://www.esfm.ipn.mx/">IPN in Mexico.</a> 
							I obtained solid foundations in mathematics and physics, which helped me to develop professionally 
							in applications of mathematics to various problems in the industry.</p>

							<p style="padding-left:20px;">My thesis work was on the application of algebraic topology in economics 
							(paradox of social choice) under the supervision of the <a href="">Phd. Jesus Gonzales Espino.</a></p>
								
							<p style="padding-left:20px;">In parallel, I worked as a research assistant in Time Series and Complex Systems 
							applications at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/guzmanlev/">UPIITA-IPN Complex Systems Laboratory</a>, 
							under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/guzmanlev/Home#h.p_ID_32">Phd. Lev Guzman</a>. 
							I also worked as a research assistant in Mathematical Analysis under the supervision of 
							<a href="https://www.math.cinvestav.mx/~eramirez/">Phd.Ram√≠rez de Arellano</a>.</p>
								
							<p style="padding-left:20px;">I learned to program in C, C ++, Pytho, R, SQL and Bash before finishing college, 
								and since 2008 I started to implement and develop components and models for various business cases.
								Since 2012 I specialized in Forecasting Models, I developed models for various companies, including Softtek, 
								which predicted the demand for applications or systems (of more than 100 systems).</p>

							<p style="padding-left:20px;">After 2015 I specialized in Machine Learning and started using 
							Deep Learning for different problems. In general, most of my projects have been on 3 topics:</p>
							<li style="padding-left:20px;">Detection of Anomalies (Fraud, risks, anomalies)</li>
							<li style="padding-left:20px;">Segmentation (Customer classification, post or text 
								categorization, etc.)</li>
							<li style="padding-left:20px;">Forecasting Models (time series, multi time series, 
								regressive models, etc.)</li>
								<br>
							<p style="padding-left:20px;">Recently I have worked on projects that require the 
									implementation of NLP techniques, both to process texts and to create chatbots.</p>
							
									<p style="padding-left:20px;"></p>If you want to review more about projects in my professional 
									career, you can read my resume or you can send me a message and I will gladly answer you.</p>

							<h2 style="font-weight: bold;padding-left:30px;">Courses and Certifications</h2>
							<h4 style="font-weight:normal;padding-left:20px;">I only mention the most relevant courses for my professional career, 
								with respect to the courses taken at the university I took courses up to <a href="https://www.math.cinvestav.mx/maestria">masters in Mathematics</a>,
								 but I did not get my master's degree.</h4>
